Note: the spaces between numbers mean that each of the numbers was transferred
in separate SPIXfer function. A driver command calls this function several times
CS is pulled low and high between each transfer (see SPIXfer function)

Number of board objects. Equals number of declared boards

### dataPacket ###
##################
dataPacket is a _numBoards*4 matrix containing the data byte from earlier.
Might be split up though in several SPIXfer commands! Check further.
Example:
dataPacket = [  [65,0,0,200]
                [65,0,0,200]  ]
